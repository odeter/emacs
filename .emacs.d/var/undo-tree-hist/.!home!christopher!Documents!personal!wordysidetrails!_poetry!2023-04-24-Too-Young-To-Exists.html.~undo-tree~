([nil nil ((#("From the dawn of my time, to the end of my road, i will try to exist, <br/>
to find my place of being. For though the privilege of youth in this day <br/>
and age is grand, i find my possibilities many, even sometime without
limit. Which should inflate me with joy and grit, that my life is open
in all directions. But though the sky is breached for me and me alone,
the blood and sweat of my ancestor weighs heavily upon me. For am
i blessed or cursed with a life without limits, surely i could not say
no, no in disrespect, in disbelieve. An insult to all that has been done
before me would it be, to simply pass on a chance so many before has
lived without, a chance they didn’t get.
The choice it weights me down from so young an age, í should
count myself blessed but instead feel myself pressed against the ground.
For with freedom comes responsibility, to take the correct road, to
make the right choice. I fear deeply i might spill my chance, i might
take the wrong door, though all are open and i see through them to
the end. My life before my eyes, how it would shape, how it would
tear in each and every direction. I feel myself punched down a road
splitting unto hundreds. Take a road, make a choice, your life and
future depends upon it, don’t waste your chance, your golden ticket,
that so many fought to give you. As i start to walk upon the dusty
road i feel panic and fear as my heart pumps and pumps away. I don’t
know which path to choose and soon there will be no more delay. My
heart jump and my focus i loose as the path must be chosen, for i
don’t know which road to take, which one to bet my chance on. Some-
times i wish for no chance at all, no choice or road to take, to throw
overboard my existential crisis, to just be happy, to just exist." 70 71 (tag-name "br" tag-type void tag-beg 24 font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-bracket-face) 71 73 (tag-name "br" tag-type void font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-face) 73 74 (tag-name "br" tag-type void font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-bracket-face) 74 75 (tag-name "br" tag-type void tag-end t font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-bracket-face) 149 150 (tag-name "br" tag-type void tag-beg 24 font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-bracket-face) 150 152 (tag-name "br" tag-type void font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-face) 152 153 (tag-name "br" tag-type void font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-bracket-face) 153 154 (tag-name "br" tag-type void tag-end t font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-bracket-face)) . 68) (undo-tree-id10 . -76) (undo-tree-id11 . -1769) (undo-tree-id12 . -793) (undo-tree-id13 . -154) (undo-tree-id14 . -793) (undo-tree-id15 . -149) (undo-tree-id16 . -1769) (undo-tree-id17 . -154) (undo-tree-id18 . -1769) (t 25670 62269 947786 315000)) nil (25670 65442 244312 484000) 0 nil])
