to find my place of being. For though the privilege of youth in this day <br/>
and age is grand, i find my possibilities many, even sometime without
limit. Which should inflate me with joy and grit, that my life is open
in all directions. But though the sky is breached for me and me alone,
the blood and sweat of my ancestor weighs heavily upon me. For am
i blessed or cursed with a life without limits, surely i could not say
no, no in disrespect, in disbelieve. An insult to all that has been done
before me would it be, to simply pass on a chance so many before has
lived without, a chance they didn’t get.
The choice it weights me down from so young an age, í should
count myself blessed but instead feel myself pressed against the ground.
For with freedom comes responsibility, to take the correct road, to
make the right choice. I fear deeply i might spill my chance, i might
take the wrong door, though all are open and i see through them to
the end. My life before my eyes, how it would shape, how it would
tear in each and every direction. I feel myself punched down a road
splitting unto hundreds. Take a road, make a choice, your life and
future depends upon it, don’t waste your chance, your golden ticket,
that so many fought to give you. As i start to walk upon the dusty
road i feel panic and fear as my heart pumps and pumps away. I don’t
know which path to choose and soon there will be no more delay. My
heart jump and my focus i loose as the path must be chosen, for i
don’t know which road to take, which one to bet my chance on. Some-
times i wish for no chance at all, no choice or road to take, to throw
overboard my existential crisis, to just be happy, to just exist." 70 71 (tag-name "br" tag-type void tag-beg 24 font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-bracket-face) 71 73 (tag-name "br" tag-type void font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-face) 73 74 (tag-name "br" tag-type void font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-bracket-face) 74 75 (tag-name "br" tag-type void tag-end t font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-bracket-face) 149 150 (tag-name "br" tag-type void tag-beg 24 font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-bracket-face) 150 152 (tag-name "br" tag-type void font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-face) 152 153 (tag-name "br" tag-type void font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-bracket-face) 153 154 (tag-name "br" tag-type void tag-end t font-lock-face web-mode-html-tag-bracket-face)) . 68) (undo-tree-id0 . -76) (undo-tree-id1 . -1769) (undo-tree-id2 . -1769) (undo-tree-id3 . -1769) (undo-tree-id4 . -1769) (t 25670 62269 947786 0)) nil (25670 64340 746435 623000) 0 nil])

closed by friends and strangers alike. The bar was filled with smoke
and talk of merry folks, the music flew above them carrying old and
familiar tunes, bringing memories, bringing joy. He sat and listened
to the conversation flying between his friends and friends to be, talk-
ing about all, talking about none, ever so often laughter would erupt
and he felt himself letting go, just laughing and nothing more. The
beers where plenty and the bar was filled with people near his own
age, young people, dreaming people, living people, all talking about
their lives and how they could fix the world. So many ideas were
shared, so many would be forgotten tomorrow replaced by the pain
repressed the night before. Though they knew the pain, from Fri-
days passed and gone, they always took another beer as they kept
the dawn at bay. He felt ecstatic in this moment as he looked around
his table, filled with friends and newcomers who joined the conver-
sation, joined their little temporary unity, all laughing, all being. He
felt empowered by the cold, gold beer, giving him confidence and reas-
surance that he could take on any challenge life would throw at him,
today or tomorrow, no task seemed too big and no worry too over-
whelming. The moment came over him with the laughter, the beer
and the music, as he just sat there quietly with a beer in hand, he
felt a sensational relaxation with no strings attached as the music
played up and the laughter suddenly faded.

He came back to his senses, felt the weight of his empty beer bot-

his colleagues at eight he would have to get up at seven. He looked up
at the clock watching bare and cold over the crowd, and to his dread-
ful realization, he saw the clock was already a quarter to eleven." . 68) (undo-tree-id5 . -69) (undo-tree-id6 . -70) (undo-tree-id7 . -69)) (25670 64340 746159 666000) 0 nil])
