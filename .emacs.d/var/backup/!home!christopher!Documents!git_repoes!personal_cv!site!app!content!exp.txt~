At Execute

<n_field>

Here i got my first experience as a main developer of a project. The good people at Execute needed a time-registration system saving them time on administrational tasks. Together we wrote the demands and functionalities of the system down after which i could begin the structuring the system. As the only developer on this project i learned a lot about working Independent, creating and maintaining system usability as well as security. Beside that i administrated their online websites and server solutions.

Working as a mentor has given me the opportunity to help the new students getting accustom to the university way of life. Giving advise and otherwise helping them reminds me of core reasons why I choose to study computer science myself.
