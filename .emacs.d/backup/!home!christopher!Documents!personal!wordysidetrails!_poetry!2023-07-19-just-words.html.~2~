Dear rusky soldier how do you fare
So far from home in trenches deep

Was you taken from your home, from a warm embrace
perhaps you came out on your own, heading your nations call

Did you come with golden dreams
Of glory reminiscing the days of yore

in hopes the the red army would once more bring liberation
To it's war starved brothers, freeing them from Nazification

As you follow your trusted leader, his stream of unconstested truth
as you ventured into the war, one brought upon you by words alone

But as we hear it, as we are told, this war is naught but imperial expansion
The news we hear make us hate you, Russia itself and all it implies

Yet at times we follow blindly the truth of our own as we condemn the lies of yours
As the heat of emotion makes us all blind, who's to say what is true in a war of lies

Perhaps you are in truth the one oppressed
By the evil nations that holds you down

Perhaps you are only taking precautions
Against the Western alliance evergrowimg grip

Perhaps your mother weep tears of joy as your fathers heart swell with pride,
On behalf of your actions and the life you lay in the trenches of Donesk or the ruins of bakhmut

Perhaps it doesn't really matter what we say, what we hear.
The truth, the lies, the words that bekons action on either side

For can you with words wash away the sins you took upon your soul,
and the brooding red that colours the grounds of Ukraine







But to be frank whether

We only hear the horror, the ungoldly wrath that is a war of lies
Fuming we are fed news from a war




What we the privileged percieve on the spectators rows are stories told not seen.
Who's to say the news laid before us is not as tampered as the lies we believe is fed to you

For can you with words wash away the sins you took upon your soul, the blood of your brethren that colours the ground of Ukraine


The blood of your countrymen spilled for lies of for truth.


Perhaps what matters is the blood of brethren spilled in the ruins of an obliterated nation
Perhaps no truth is worth the lifes of your countrymen

In the end does any of it matter, truth or lie. When you stand in the blood of your brethren, still looking for the enemy you sat out to slay.
