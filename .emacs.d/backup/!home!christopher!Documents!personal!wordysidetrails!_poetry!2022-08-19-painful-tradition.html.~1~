To live is to feel pain,<br>
day and night, night and day.<br>
it lifts your saint less soul <br>
far above its mortal glow.<br>
Holds it fast, holds it steady,<br>
washing ungodly thoughts away.<br>
Thus remembering your earthly present,<br>
your own personal sleepy hollow.
<hr/>
Savor it, honor it, fresh from the<br>
wound never to be relinquished.<br>
For your god demands you see it through,<br>
to pay your debt in full.<br>
Might you find some sun, some joy,<br>
so utterly distinguished.<br>
As sweet as sugar it raise your spirit,<br>
but eat it not by the spoonful.
<hr/>
Hardships is the bread of life, its mere existence<br>
makes those fleeting moments so much sweeter.<br>
Be by its hand stronger, wiser and let the glimpse of <br>
relief be your guiding star leading you forever on.<br>
Let go of your ideas of comfort, cling only to your<br>
raw ideals and throw aside your inner dreamer.<br>
Alas life rewards only relentless work so grab your<br>
shovel and keep on digging, all from dusk till dawn.
<hr/>
As you hustle, you puzzle, <br>
on the great scheme of things<br>
Just to explain, to entertain, <br>
the idea that you folks were wrong<br>
To learn, to discern, <br>
that pain did not sprout you wings<br>
It led you, to a venue, <br>
where dreams are killed to a marching song.
<hr/>
before too long, you hear the song<br>
a tune so strong, you're dragged along
<hr/>
inside the venue, a shovel is passed to<br>
a tall hollowed man who, sternly address you
<hr/>
you ponder the meaning, of work so depleting<br>
that pain isn't ceasing, which keep your soul leaking
<hr/>
the man then explain, the source to your pain<br>
is lack of restrain, and declares you insane.
<hr/>
before judgments is passed you set yourself free,<br>
as you run from the shovel, from your parents decree<br>
from pain and expectations, from work and moral slope<br>
you run towards the bad advice, the fleeting glimpse of hope.
<hr/>
Outside the town, you'll finally sit down,<br>
under a great maple tree you'll be sleeping.<br>
with the wind in your hair,  people's judging glare,<br>
and a soul that's finally dreaming.
