he always end making the evil choice. He constantly ponders his actions and though he sees the evil in them he tend to
excuse them on the world and his past actions which only lead him further down more bad choices.

her to be good hearted

#### Backstory

Hector was born in a small fishing village, his father died on the sea and as Hectors mother couldn't feed both herself and him
ended up selling him to a ship crew under a passing captain Tarren. Hector both learned but also suffered under the ruthless privateer
as Tarren liked to toture him in humiliating ways. When Tarrens privateer contract ended he continued to plunder merchants and other ships
around the seas near Renetra, until Adrian army sent the Flying Flayer (at the time called Atrista) to handle him. A ship battle,
which nearly sinks Tarrens ship, sends the Marred Miracle into hiding on a nearby island of Renetra. Here Hector is usually sent into the
city to buy and plan food drops and the like, as no one will suspect a kid. But captain Morrow of the flying flayer camps out in the city and
notices a pattern. He captures Hector, forces him to tell him of the next drop and then lays a trap. He captures Tarren and his crew and keelhauls
them, flaying them to pieces hence the ship name. Hector tries to convince Tarren that he is Innocent and was forced to join the pirate crew,
Morrow believes him but tells him that even forced actions has consequences. He then tells hector to cut a pierce of himself off to atone
for his sin and to watch as Tarren and his crew are slaughtered.

After that Hector drifts around in Renetra for a time, striking up a friendship with the bar lady at the Wallow Wrench. Until finally he takes
hire on another ship as a sailor, here Hector meets Mr. Farrow, Mr. Bern and Mr. Torp. He sails with them for 9 years doing privateer work,
until they instigates a mutiny as the captain was taking too large a share of their spoils. Hector is then elected captain and he continues privateering
for 3 years. He does his job so well he is sent on a special mission for the crown to retrieve a girl (Fay) at La Trion and kill her.

Hector manage to wrestle her from the monks, though he can't bring himself to kill her and instead takes her along. (does a good deed)
The crown is not please and mark Hector as a criminal and sends the adrian fleet after him. Hector then makes a plan to steal
the yearly pay of the adrian fleet as a retirement, as he gathers intel and lay a plan. This leads him to La Travier where he expect to find
coffers of gold but instead finds a trap.

The adrain fleet has supplied the city's fortress with new longer reaching canons and explained to the citys govoner that he is to keep
men in the fort but the city open as to lure in ship and only evacuate the townsfolk when the ship is nearing the harbor, telling no one of their
plan as to not raise suspicion.
But the town is expecting a red ship (red tear) and Hector in a play of guise has repainted his ship green (green harrow). Hector goes into the
harbor and then starts to fire to make chaos giving him a chance to rob the bank. As Hector finds no gold he takes for the palace to find the
