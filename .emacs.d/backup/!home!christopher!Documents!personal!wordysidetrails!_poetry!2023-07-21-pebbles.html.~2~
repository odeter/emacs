As children we threw pebbles at the beach
Never large enough for pain but just small enough to annoy

Launched from our sovereign beach towels
Crossing the barren dessert, to arrive at our parents shore

Landing across the fleshy field
Just missing its mark, a belly button

Our parents then wiped off the pebble with a groan
Laying half asleep In the heat by the sandy shore

each pebble thrown grew great irritation
Pushing sensible grownups to the edge

Yet when we finally hit with great precision
Straight center down to the belly button core

Then edging anger erupted into laughter
And suddenly we were a nuisance no more
