I sat at a table beside a friend
out in the cold air, near a watering hole
where across us sat strangers, though they wanted to be remembered
alas their names I saw vanish on the same smoke from whence they came

Through empty pitchers and lingering cigarettes one stranger asked my friend
a question which held no tighter than their name, but with it came her hand
as she waved for our attention. My friend he answered with a smile and as a gesture
he held her hand beside the pitcher.

She talked on and so did he, they made no notion of this sudden devotion
to hold a strangers hand. Each caressing the others for a fleeting moment.



Had he instead taken her then and there in a wet expression of sexual desire,


No one but me seemed to notice this sudden hand holding, and the hands did
part at the change of the talk. Yet neither he nor her send eyes of desire,
as they sat in front of a future stranger







# Pebbles

As children, we threw pebbles at the beach
never large enough for pain but just small enough to annoy

Launched from our sovereign beach towels
crossing the barren desert, to arrive at our parents' shore

Landing across the fleshy field
just missing its mark, a belly button

Our parents then wiped off the pebble with a groan
laying half asleep In the heat by the sandy shore

Each pebble thrown grew great irritation
pushing sensible grownups to the edge

Yet when we finally hit with great precision
straight center down to the belly button core

Then edging anger erupted into laughter
and suddenly we were a nuisance no more
