My Dad, my father, a soldier man<br/>
why he choose war over family I didn't understand
<hr/>
As a child I saw him leave for a foreign nation<br/>
for a course far beyond my own comprehension
<hr/>
As the years passed I heard him repeat the reason<br/>
though it seemed to change once every season
<hr/>
The first one I heard was about helping people<br/>
to protect their new nation so young and feeble
<hr/>
Then came one of support and deep family devotion<br/>
as only men grazed by battle had any chance of promotion
<hr/>
The last one I heard ringed to me most true<br/>
that man must answer when obligation is due
