It smells like rain<br/>
The faint bouquet of anticipation<br/>
It accompanies her words and teary eyes<br/>
'I love you no more' she tries to say<br/>
<hr/>
But she chokes
<hr/>
The truth trapped behind gasping sobs<br/>
I say naught, I love her still<br/>
waiting as I inhale the frail fetor of coming change<br/>
It smells like rain
