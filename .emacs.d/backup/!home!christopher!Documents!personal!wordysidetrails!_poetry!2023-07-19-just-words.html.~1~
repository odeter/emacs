He sold ideas in spades<br/>
unpolished and raw
<hr/>
Every fantasy that would sell<br/>
was sold below the bar
<hr/>
When ideas ran dry<br/>
he sold his good name
<hr/>
sold to any who would buy<br/>
without thought or shame
<hr/>
with a name spelled in sand<br/>
he then auctioned off his voice
<hr/>
which used to yell somber truth<br/>
now paid to play frantic noise
<hr/>
In the end naught was left but his physique<br/>
which he sold to deviants at a loss
<hr/>
Empty he stands, without soul, name or body<br/>
rich enough to buy all, but the man he once was
