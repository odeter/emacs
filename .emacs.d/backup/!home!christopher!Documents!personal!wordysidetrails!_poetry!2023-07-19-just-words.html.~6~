Dear rusky soldier how do you fare<br/>
so far from home in trenches deep
<hr/>
Were you taken from a warm embrace<br/>
or did you heed your nation's call
<hr/>
Did you come with golden dreams<br/>
of glory like the days of old
<hr/>
To cross the Dnieper River, as you did in 43'<br/>
and once again disperse the nazi scourge
<hr/>
To follow thus a man of steel, though his walrus did fall off<br/>
to venture into deadly war, one of supposed necessity
<hr/>
De-Nazification and military operation <br/>
the shaven metal man hoist and holler<br/>
words of terror, of allegations, thrown about and all around
<hr/>
Some are lies, some are truths <br/>
but which is which is hard to hear<br/>
yet I always frown upon those that do bring war around
<hr/>
Dear rusky soldier, I must admit<br/>
these words I write echo those I heard<br/>
I don't believe your cause is just, but in truth I can't be certain
<hr/>
Perhaps you are the one oppressed<br/>
as evil nations hold you down
<hr/>
Perhaps you are only taking precautions<br/>
against the growing Western world
<hr/>
Perhaps your mother weeps tears of joy<br/>
as your father's heart swell with pride<br/>
on behalf of your actions and the life you lay<br/>
in the trenches of Donesk, in the ruins of Bakhmut
<hr/>
Perhaps it doesn't matter what we say, what we hear<br/>
the truth, the lies, the words that beckons action on either side
<hr/>
For can you with words wash away the sins you took upon your soul<br/>
and the brooding red that colors the grounds of Ukraine
