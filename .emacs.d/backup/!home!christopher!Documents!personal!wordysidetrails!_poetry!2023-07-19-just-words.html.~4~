Dear rusky soldier how do you fare
So far from home in trenches deep

were you taken from a warm embrace
or did you heed your nations call

Did you come with golden dreams
Of glory reminiscing the days of yore

did you hope the red army would once more bring liberation
To it's war starved brothers, freeing them from Nazification

As you follow your trusted leader, his stream of unconstested truth
as you ventured into the war, one brought upon you by words alone

But as we hear it, as we are told, this war is naught but horror
the news we hear make us hate, the russian word and all it touches

// The news we hear make us hate you, Russia itself and all it implies

Yet at times we follow blindly the truth of our own, as we condemn the lies of yours
As the heat of emotion makes us all blind, who's to say what is true in a war of lies

Perhaps you are in truth, the one oppressed
By evil nations holding you down

Perhaps you are only taking precautions
Against the growing Western world

// alliance evergrowimg grip

Perhaps your mother weep tears of joy as your fathers heart swell with pride,
On behalf of your actions and the life you lay in the trenches of Donesk or the ruins of bakhmut

Perhaps it doesn't really matter what we say, what we hear.
The truth, the lies, the words that bekons action on either side

For can you with words wash away the sins you took upon your soul,
and the brooding red that colours the grounds of Ukraine
