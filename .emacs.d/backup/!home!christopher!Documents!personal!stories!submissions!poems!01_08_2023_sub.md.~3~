# Are you alone

'Are you alone?' is a question that daunts me, vexes me, frightens me
I can almost smell the words 'fore they pass across their lips
their reeking odor, just as stomach turning as when they ask 'Are you happy?'

their words are loaded with pretext, preconception
Expecting sorrow from a missing companion, a missing love, as should
the mere presence of new human flesh bring ease and soothe an aching heart

I smile and shrug it off, their inquiry desevers no better answer
for a sufficient one would take time to tell, though I doubt if I could

I feel alone, at certain times, when the witching hour dwells and I
reach out to find an empty space, my hand hoping to catch a glimpse of
warmth but finding naught but cold covers

I feel happy, at certain times, when the warming sun sends its heart
and endorphins down for me to bask in on the garden grass
When new beginnings roar all doubt aside and wash my shoulders free of weight

Complexity is to me a synonym for things I can't explain
sorrow, relief and solitude all roam around me in messy matrimony
A deep breath, before I answer all questions just the same

"It's complicated"


# Pebbles

As children, we threw pebbles at the beach
never large enough for pain but just small enough to annoy

Launched from our sovereign beach towels
crossing the barren desert, to arrive at our parents' shore

Landing across the fleshy field
just missing its mark, a belly button

Our parents then wiped off the pebble with a groan
laying half asleep In the heat by the sandy shore

Each pebble thrown grew great irritation
pushing sensible grownups to the edge

Yet when we finally hit with great precision
straight center down to the belly button core

Then edging anger erupted into laughter
and suddenly we were a nuisance no more

# It smells like rain

It smells like rain
The faint bouquet of anticipation
It accompanies her words and teary eyes
'I love you no more' she tries to say

But she chokes

The truth trapped behind gasping sobs
I say naught, I love her still
waiting as I inhale the frail fetor of coming change
It smells like rain
