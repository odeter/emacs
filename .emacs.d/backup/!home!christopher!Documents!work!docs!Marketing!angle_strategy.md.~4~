# Angle New strategy

## Current situation

### Where are we today

- We have an NDR product that is primarily targeted towards small/medium customers, and customers who does not have existing network log gathering setups.
  As ours is more easy to setup as a complete solution in regard to data gathering and log processing.
- Current customers include small waterworks and selfservice customers (mediq)
- We get most if not all of our current feedback from our own IT Security specialists
- Our product is nearing a more stable phase, especially our data analysis tool and our external sensor software (not including our current hardware issues)
- Our product is directed towards local data flows, e.g we do not yet have cloud support.

### What hypothesis have we tried

- Untapped market sectors such as waterworks could provide a good income base with enough customers, we can compete on price and ease of setup.
- Self sign up and free private usage leads to an increase in customers

### What have we leaned

- Small market sectors such as waterworks are tough to break into. They lack money, usually basic understanding of IT Security related risk,
  has no state requirement to up their security practices and thus fails to see the need. (check whether sectors are mature enough?)
- When cooperating with an external IT Security consultant firm who will peddle our software with their services, we will have to make sure one of two things.
  Either the consultants of the external firm has to match our current security competence level,
  or we have to further simplify our product, maybe on the expense of accuracy or quality
- It is difficult to simplify our network analysis process enough that ordinary people with no prior knowledge can seamlessly use it
  while we can still truthfully call it data analysis.
  (harder to convince customers to switch products if not intuitive enough, both analysis approach and ease of use of product)
- AI integration has a tendency to cut corners and deem too broad on connection, resulting in too poor performance.
  We need more machine learning skill to be able to properly translate our data analysis process into an machine learning model,
  either that or we need to find a machine learning firm with network analysis experience. (what data could we train it on, logdata, filters, triggers)
- To supply hardware products on a budget is complicated and requires a lot of support.
  (this could be solved by imposing a certain demand of customer hardware competence, e.g. less support)
- Human part of our product gives better result BUT cost more

### What hypothesis do we have today

- Integrating towards bigger platforms could open pathways into bigger corporations who have already established IT security systems
- Companies who have a lot of IOT devices could be a good fit for out product
  - What size customer should we target, are OT firms mature enough and is there a need to explore?
- The seclusion of AI make us stand out
  - Which customer type are we selling to (Technicians or C level)?
- how do we introduce users into our way of thinking (in terms of data analysis) in a smooth and intuitive way
- Lean up against established network or incident response methods, while still maintaining a unique aspect.
- Assets management
- angle as primary incident response product
- Possible AI usage, how to implement in a transparent way

### Define which markets open and closes based on product path / points above

- More emphasis on a self contained NDR system push us more towards firms who have not already implemented NDR like software,
  which is usally small or medium sized firms, as we likely miss references and proof of usage to sell ourselves into larger corporations.
- Likely with more focus on integration into larger systems/platforms will make us more attractive to larger companies,
  as we can be used as a small wheel in a larger machinery.
  Though the more we focus on being integrateable the less we will likely focus on being capable of running self contained.

# Five p's of marketing

## Product

Our primary software product is angle, which we here see as the combination of the sensor software and the angle platform.

#### Functionality

The sensor software offers:

- Easy installation on Linux operated appropriate hardware via command line PPA. There's no need of passing bash files around and the user,
  given that they trust us, can safely download our software from a PPA. A system which most linux users trust
- This software collects zeek and suricata files and pass them on to our platform.
- Low hardware requirements
- Software transparency

The angle platform offers:

- Log overview where the user can investigate connections through each log type
- Rapport generation, which can give the user an overview
- Dashboard, which gives a simple overview of the dataflow and newly raised alarms
- Log Filtering, enables the user to filter out the most important or filter out the noise. Our own language but strongly build after SQL
- Triggers, able to create and group alarms based on filtered data
- Azure and servicenow integration
- Third party data enhancers, such as Abuseipdb

#### Branding

We offer the customer an NDR system that is easy to install and get running. Our system provides the user with an data overview which they can modify
and shape into a picture that perfectly contain their companies network policies. This system transparency stands in contrast to AI driven NDR products
where the user has to rely almost completely on an Machine learning algorithm located inside a black box.

## Price

We have different payment plans which invovles different levels of security support,
this gives the user the ability to find choose their optimal level of assistant and price range.

## Promotion

We promote our product at security conventions and through our professional relations

## Place

Out distribution channels are online and via our website, though we do not have any dedicated sales department.

## People

Our current customers usually needs IT security expertise knowledge and a rather high service level.

The service we currently provide are:
- IT Security consulting
- Hardware support
- Network security management

Our employee's:
- Heavy IT security knowledge
- High competence means high payroll
- Have System and development competence
- Consulting experience
- Experience with small firms network setups

# SWOT

## Strength

- expert IT security knowledge
- software development capability
- experience running server systems
- consulting experience
- experience with small firm network setups
- Have a simple network log recording and viewing setup (angle + sensor software)
- Unqiue approach to network analysis (No AI, and network security through recoginzing good trafic instead of emphasising on the bad)
- Higher level of security

## Weakness

- Lacking marketing
- Established competitor NDR products
- No expert AI knowledge
- No expert Frontend designer
- Limited resources
- No AI (weakness or strength depends how you look)
- Product requires more engagement from customer
- Product requires higher level of IT knowledge from user
- Product have higher initial startup cost, in manpower or expense if hiring extern consultants

## Opportunity

- Conflicts create a greater demands for security products? (ukraine)
- EU legislations (NIST)
- Firms get more and more IOT products, does the need of monitoring rise as well?
- Vestas

## Threats

- More focus on AI
- Fewer firms have need of high level network security (just needs enough to pass certification)
- Manual log monitoring becoming abandonded by market (too expensive?)
- High value market attracts alot of silicon valley funded companies

# Competition

- IOT
  - domotz
    Has monitor software integration to dockers, cloud, windows, linux etc.
    - Installs client on all servers instead of on entry/exists point
    - Has network overview
    - Has TCP Open Port Scanner (WAN side) and UPnP Port Forwarding Scanner (LAN side)
    - TCP trafic monitoring
    - SNMP
