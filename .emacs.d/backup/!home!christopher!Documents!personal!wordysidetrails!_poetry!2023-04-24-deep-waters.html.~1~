Don’t go near the water child,<br/>
you don’t know its hunger<br/>
The flesh it craves for those below,<br/>
be it man, grown or younger
<hr/>
In the depths where darkness lies,<br/>
lacking hope, glow or light<br/>
in breathless waters there monsters reign<br/>
by mystic, fear and endless might
<hr/>
Freightful place yet still it beckons<br/>
spirites with a crave to sate<br/>
Why they heed it I cannot fathom,<br/>
they speak of it as was it fate
<hr/>
For poor men who take to sea,<br/>
leave family and home behind<br/>
Only to chase golden dreams,<br/>
eagerly with a cross they signed
<hr/>
Seldom do they return,<br/>
by the choice of others or of their own<br/>
Those who do have seen the beast,<br/>
their soul corrupted to the bone
<hr/>
So mark my words, steer clear my child,<br/>
stay dry and don’t you wet your toe<br/>
It ate your father whole the fool,<br/>
I wont have you added to my woe
