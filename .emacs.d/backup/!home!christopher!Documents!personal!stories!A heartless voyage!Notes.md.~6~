harbor and then starts to fire to make chaos giving him a chance to rob the bank. As Hector finds no gold he takes for the palace to find the

wounds up. Mr. Farrow welcomed the change as the hard labor was a bit taxing on him, when Hector started a mutiny he joined most out of fear on
being on the wrong side. He was chosen to be Sailingmaster because the crew trusted him and his abilities. Ever since Mr. Farrow has followed Hector

has left him twisted and unpredictable. He wants any situation where he is in full control. He was the one who wanted to start the mutiny
though the rest of the crew had to be convinced by Hector. Mr. Bern was appointed boatswain simply because he had a large role in the mutiny
and no other wanted to take the position from him out of fear. Mr. Bern happily followed Hector as a privateer, though he was initially angry
over the choice to spare Fay he did rejoice when they transitioned over into true piracy. He followed Hectors orders to a T, while endulging
in his sick cravings as much as he could. When they were too far and over their head, he still opposed Hectors suggestion to lay low and work
as merchants for a while. This however was voted through and though it lasted much longer than anticipated Mr. Bern still didn't jump ship.
