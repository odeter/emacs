'Are you alone?' is a question that daunts me, vexes me, frightens me<br/>
I can almost smell the words 'fore they pass across their lips<br/>
their reeking odor, just as stomach turning as when they ask 'Are you happy?'<br/>
<hr/>
their words are loaded with pretext, preconception<br/>
Expecting sorrow from a missing companion, a missing love, as should<br/>
the mere presence of new human flesh bring ease and soothe an aching heart<br/>
<hr/>
I smile and shrug it off, their inquiry desevers no better answer<br/>
for a sufficient one would take time to tell, though I doubt if I could<br/>
<hr/>
I feel alone, at certain times, when the witching hour dwells and I<br/>
reach out to find an empty space, my hand hoping to catch a glimpse of<br/>
warmth but finding naught but cold covers<br/>
<hr/>
I feel happy, at certain times, when the warming sun sends its heart<br/>
and endorphins down for me to lie and bask in on the garden grass<br/>
When new beginnings roar all doubt aside and wash my shoulders free of weight<br/>
<hr/>
Complexity is to me a synonym for things I can't explain<br/>
sorrow, relief and solitude all roam around me in messy matrimony<br/>
A deep breath, before I answer all questions just the same<br/>
<hr/>
"It's complicated"
