I put on a face fore I depart<br/>
dazzling and highly smart
<hr/>
Fitting for my daily task<br/>
I hide behind a timid mask
<hr/>
Smiling, crying or any expression<br/>
I have one for each occasion
<hr/>
Which mimics feelings so sincere<br/>
in place of those I lack severe
<hr/>
After the days' charade I return and light a candle<br/>
as I take off my mask and place it on the mantle
<hr/>
In the mask is a reflection causing me to stare<br/>
as I see the face of a man, that's no longer there
