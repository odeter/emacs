As children, we threw pebbles at the beach<br/>
never large enough for pain but just small enough to annoy
<hr/>
Launched from our sovereign beach towels<br/>
crossing the barren desert, to arrive at our parents' shore
<hr/>
Landing across the fleshy field<br/>
just missing its mark, a belly button
<hr/>
Our parents then wiped off the pebble with a groan<br/>
laying half asleep In the heat by the sandy shore
<hr/>
Each pebble thrown grew great irritation<br/>
pushing sensible grownups to the edge
<hr/>
Yet when we finally hit with great precision<br/>
straight center down to the belly button core
<hr/>
Then edging anger erupted into laughter<br/>
and suddenly we were a nuisance no more
