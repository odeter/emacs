Dreams belong to those who wander<br/>
ripping doubts and fears asunder<br/>
they scoff at any mortal responsibility<br/>
sees no feat outside their godlike ability
<hr/>
You meet 'em on the dusty road<br/>
In fancy dress and buttoned coat<br/>
the way they act, they seem so certain<br/>
switfly they promise to ease your burden
<hr/>
yet all they ask a mere transaction<br/>
in turn for heavenly satisfaction<br/>
an open mind without distraction<br/>
to lend your heart a fleeting passion
<hr/>
As time walks by they won't deliver<br/>
the promises given they twist and wither<br/>
so you stand on naught but hope alone<br/>
as doubt seeps through each borrowed bone
<hr/>
Bound your soul to hopeful torment<br/>
for the vow of joy in a fleeting moment<br/>
where admiration first stayed your hand<br/>
you soon find it crumbling like flakes of sand
<hr/>
that rather you'd take horrible reality<br/>
Over the pledge of godlike immortality<br/>
Then find your hand on their precious neck<br/>
Above buttoned coats bought by unsigned cheques
<hr/>
As you tighten your grip with growing doubt<br/>
<i>"Free me, love me, kill me"</i> they scream and shout<br/>
As the silence soon drown out helpless pleas<br/>
With realization of that you did with ease
<hr/>
Killed you did a wandering dreamer<br/>
That twisted your mind like a delirious fever<br/>
Left you scarred, hopeless and broken<br/>
and from your precious dreams awoken
