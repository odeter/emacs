<p>Finally, the website is done and uploaded. I have added some poems I had lying around and the short story, <i>A Scent of Roses</i>. Minor improvements to the site might be pushed over time (such as search functionality), but for now the amount of poems shouldn't prove too great a difficulty to manage through.</p>

<p>Currently the site is split up into three content types, poems, stories and post. The post section will consist mainly of update posts, as the main content will consists of poetry and stories. Poems as well as stories can be read directly on the site, though longer pieces will typically be uploaded to an online reading platform, like Wattpad or Inkitt. The stories section will therefore be an overview of all currently published works, together with links to a given platform if needed.</p>

<p>I hope this site will provide you with a brief escape from your daily trials, even if only for a minute or two.</p>
