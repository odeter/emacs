# Roadmap

## Maj

- Test backup restore process (use hare) (Done)
  - clickhouse server backup (research) (success goals) https://github.com/AlexAkulov/clickhouse-backup
- angle API for system integration (documentation and possibly oauth2 token implementation) (vestas)
  - Firm management (done)
  - Sensor management (done)
  - Stats (done)
  - alarm management (done)
  - trigger management (done)
  - filter creation (done)
  - filter selection (done)
  - report generation (done)
  - user management (done)
  - logs extraction (almost done)
- Angle mail - Remember to check spam message (Done)
- upgrade/deploy new mail server (simon + rasmus) (christopher setup meeting) (Done)
  - Backup mail server (done)
- integration of encrichment take 3:

    - speedguide - no api, solution would be scraping
    - IANA port db - just ordinary port information no malware +1 (Done)
  - Virustotal (api available REST, 4 requests per minute, public api must not be used in commercial products or services) +1
  - urlscan (scanning url site, free api, limited request (has to wait for scan to finnish) +1) (Done)
  - greynoise (Cost 27.000 dollars yearly)
  - abuse.ch (good option for file hash and blacklists!) (Done) (onsdag Henrik feedback)
  - Robtex (ip range ownership (firm etc.) has free api, limited request) (Done)

### Extra
    - Added sensor software support for 20.04
    - sensor version structure reorder
    - Server hotfixes (hare, srv07)

## Juni + Juli

- Some sensor debugging (ongoing, properly kernel problem?)

- angle api docs

- push custom suricata rules to sensor (vestas) (ongoing, missing frontend)
- shared calendar (mail server) (simon)

- Waterworks baseline (ongoing) (waiting for data) (emillie tjekker midtfyn)

- Integration of exports take 2:
  - ServiceNow (pull information about incident)
  - XSoar

- OpenLDAP integration for SSO (vestas) (third part authentication)

- Filter Library functionality
  - Extend filter popup window
    - Sort on additional parameters
    - filter additional parameters (tags, logtypes, TOC, owner)
  - match exisiting filters on new base lining
    - Write compare functions to filters
    - match on certain percentage (80-90%?)
    - Warn user that a matching filter already exists (if saving)
- testing process (research + docs) (7 hours)

## August

- testing pipeline (fix pytest clickhouse docker problem)
- clickhouse backup https://github.com/AlexAkulov/clickhouse-backup
- Cloud - marketplace x 3 (sensor software integration)
- network overview redesign (scope finding)

## September

- Integration of log sources take 2:
  - Barracuda
  - Fortinet
  - Windows defender (app required)
  - Mcafee
  - norton
  - others?
  - extra sensors/probes?
- Move Notify functionality to integration
  - Make it a table of its own
  - Move notify functionality to its own integration page
  - Only show notify functions when integration is active

## October

- Frontend UI Review
- Analysetool:
  - filter input auto complete
  - filter input color coding
  - filter number of rows it removed (perhaps written in the chip? or an popup?)
  - Frontend search (search local data before request)
  - Icon on datapoints with raised alarms

## November

- Report
  - Desc module (Add more info to each alarm, desc, signature etc.)
  - Alarm table sorting
  - Report service (e.g make table displaying most used services)
  - Connection Map module
  - custom client mail server (e.g angle takes some external access information)

## December

- Sensor overview sorting/filtering
  - Extend sorting functions, based on triggers?
  - Extend filtering, paymentplan, firms etc.
- Trigger cronjob optimize performance



# Back log

- Dashboards Customizable
  - Use searchs / filters results as data
  - graphical representation of data
  - Data preview to deepdive

- Sysadmin dashboard (with sensor stats, alarm stats (ordered by firm and alarm level), maybe data stats)

- Resend sensor data from server via command from central server (extend local ppa function)

- Angle mobile app
- Analysetool:
  - Query splitup
    - Split given query out to per day and run until max rows is reached (1000 returned to user)
    - Give feedback to user when query is running
  - Undo button to filter (save X number of steps)
  - SW operator (what is it??)
  - Remove temp filter should give popup or put filter into text field
  - Save temp filter should apply and remove old chip
- alarm table
  - Add suricata signature
  - Add second id for organization
  - Alarm see all data point with one click (Make copy of trigger/filter when new alarm is raised, keep in same table)
  - Split alarm rows by comparison columns (remove raised\_by, firm, alarm\_id, gather all hotlinks under one column)
  - Move alarm information popup to row extension instead, reevaluate which information is needed
  - Choose filter from filter library popup should mark correct filter in analysetool and be ready to edit.
- Alarm Action cards (self hosted)
- Billing functionality (find scope)
  - saas system payment (research) stripe.com, recurly.com
- Connection map
  - goto data (to analysetool)
  - Danish language overlay
- DBI integration
  - Alarm info in sms
  - DBI incident api
- group moderator (new time intervals for dashboard)
- Halfspace algorithm implementation
- new sensor/probes:
  - active probe, dhcp
    - sensor configuration (specific for each sensor) (frontend, backend, db)
  - flight recorder (sensor)
  - local dns probe
- recall old raspberry pi 10 sensors (replace with new hardware?)
- Suricata column leftovers (review and integrate)
- Testing Auto
  - Backend testing, reimplement pytest (CI/CD flow)
  - Frontend testing??
- Validated or community based filter sharing

## Bugs

- Retire alarm (emillie checks)
- filter topbar mark not setting name
