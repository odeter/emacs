# Agenda

- Status
- New tasks
  - Security check angle (give less information via error messages)
  - File hashing logs
  - Fix log settings edgecase in analysetool (As log columns can change, remember to check whether setting should be applied)
- Other

# Roadmap

## September

- testing pipeline (fix pytest clickhouse docker problem) (done)
- clickhouse backup https://github.com/AlexAkulov/clickhouse-backup (find alternative)

- Cloud integration
  - Port sensor software to a cloud environment
    - What logs can we access out of the box
    - Can we install zeek and suricata packages? or is that a separate marketplace product
    - Send log from cloud sensor to angle
  - AWS support
  - Google cloud support

- Alarm emails (almost done)
  - emails not received fix (bug)
  - sysadmin mail subscription to separate firms
  - email grouping?
  - trigger reviews (done)

- meeting about angle (core features, direction etc.) (ongoing)

- Integration of log sources take 2: (ongoing)
  - Barracuda
  - Fortinet
  - Windows defender (app required)
  - Mcafee
  - norton
  - others?
  - extra sensors/probes?

- Move Notify functionality to integration (done)
  - Make it a table of its own
  - Move notify functionality to its own integration page
  - Only show notify functions when integration is active

- Tooltips to log columns like history (done)
- Sensor ppa updated (done)

## October

- Frontend UI Review
- Analysetool:
  - filter input auto complete
  - filter input color coding
  - filter number of rows it removed (perhaps written in the chip? or an popup?)
  - Frontend search (search local data before request)
  - Icon on datapoints with raised alarms

## November

- Report
  - Desc module (Add more info to each alarm, desc, signature etc.)
  - Alarm table sorting
  - Report service (e.g make table displaying most used services)
  - Connection Map module
  - custom client mail server (e.g angle takes some external access information)

## December

- Sensor overview sorting/filtering
  - Extend sorting functions, based on triggers?
  - Extend filtering, paymentplan, firms etc.
- Trigger cronjob optimize performance




# Back log

- XSoar integration
- network overview redesign (scope finding)

- Dashboards Customizable
  - Use searchs / filters results as data
  - graphical representation of data
  - Data preview to deepdive

- Sysadmin dashboard (with sensor stats, alarm stats (ordered by firm and alarm level), maybe data stats)

- Resend sensor data from server via command from central server (extend local ppa function)

- Angle mobile app
- Analysetool:
  - Query splitup
    - Split given query out to per day and run until max rows is reached (1000 returned to user)
    - Give feedback to user when query is running
  - Undo button to filter (save X number of steps)
  - SW operator (what is it??)
  - Remove temp filter should give popup or put filter into text field
  - Save temp filter should apply and remove old chip
- alarm table
  - Add suricata signature
  - Add second id for organization
  - Alarm see all data point with one click (Make copy of trigger/filter when new alarm is raised, keep in same table)
  - Split alarm rows by comparison columns (remove raised\_by, firm, alarm\_id, gather all hotlinks under one column)
  - Move alarm information popup to row extension instead, reevaluate which information is needed
  - Choose filter from filter library popup should mark correct filter in analysetool and be ready to edit.
- Alarm Action cards (self hosted)
- Billing functionality (find scope)
  - saas system payment (research) stripe.com, recurly.com
- Connection map
  - goto data (to analysetool)
  - Danish language overlay
- DBI integration
  - Alarm info in sms
  - DBI incident api
- group moderator (new time intervals for dashboard)
- Halfspace algorithm implementation
- new sensor/probes:
  - active probe, dhcp
    - sensor configuration (specific for each sensor) (frontend, backend, db)
  - flight recorder (sensor)
  - local dns probe
- recall old raspberry pi 10 sensors (replace with new hardware?)
- Suricata column leftovers (review and integrate)
- Testing Auto
  - Backend testing, reimplement pytest (CI/CD flow)
  - Frontend testing??
- Validated or community based filter sharing

## Bugs

- Retire alarm (emillie checks)
- filter topbar mark not setting name
